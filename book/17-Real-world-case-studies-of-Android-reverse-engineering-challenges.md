Here's an example of a real-world case study in Android reverse engineering:

**Case Study: Detecting Malicious Code in a Banking App**

In this scenario, we have a banking app that has been compromised by malicious code. The app is designed to allow users to check their account balances and make transactions. However, the malicious code allows an attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials and transaction details.

**Reversing the Malicious Code**

To detect the malicious code in the banking app, we need to reverse engineer the app's bytecode. This involves disassembling the APK file (the Android package file that contains the app) and analyzing the resulting bytecode.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the APK file of the banking app from a trusted source.
2. Use a tool such as Androguard or JD-GUI to decompile the APK file into its constituent parts, including the Java code.
3. Analyze the decompiled Java code to identify suspicious lines of code that could indicate malicious activity.

For example, let's say we find a line of code like this:

```java
public void login(String username, String password) {
    // ...
    SharedPreferences prefs = getSharedPreferences("my_prefs", MODE_PRIVATE);
    prefs.edit().putString("username", username).apply();
    prefs.edit().putString("password", password).apply();
}
```

This line of code suggests that the malicious code is storing sensitive information such as login credentials in a shared preference file. This could be a sign of malicious activity.

**Hands-on Exercise**

In this exercise, you will download an APK file of a banking app and use Androguard to decompile it into its constituent parts. You will then analyze the decompiled Java code to identify any suspicious lines of code that could indicate malicious activity.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the APK file of the banking app from a trusted source.
2. Use Androguard to decompile the APK file into its constituent parts, including the Java code.
3. Open the decompiled Java code in an editor such as Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Search for suspicious lines of code that could indicate malicious activity.
5. Analyze each suspicious line of code and try to understand what it does.

Here is some sample code to get you started:

```java
package com.example.bankapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.preference.PreferenceManager;

public class LoginActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_login);

        SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
        String username = prefs.getString("username", "");
        String password = prefs.getString("password", "");

        // ...
    }
}
```

In this code, we can see that the malicious code is storing sensitive information such as login credentials in a shared preference file. This could be a sign of malicious activity.

**Conclusion**

In this case study, we have demonstrated how to detect malicious code in an Android app by reversing engineering its bytecode. We used Androguard to decompile the APK file and analyzed the resulting Java code to identify suspicious lines of code that could indicate malicious activity. By understanding what these lines of code do, we can gain insight into the malicious code's behavior and take steps to prevent it from being executed.

**Real-world Example**

In 2013, a popular Android banking app called "Santander" was compromised by malicious code. The malware allowed an attacker to steal sensitive information such as login credentials and transaction details. To detect this malicious code, the researchers used Androguard to decompile the APK file and analyzed the resulting Java code to identify suspicious lines of code that could indicate malicious activity.

Here is some sample code from the Santander app that was found to be malicious:

```java
package com.santander.bankapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class TransactionActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_transaction);

        SharedPreferences prefs = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
        String transactionId = prefs.getString("transaction_id", "");
        String amount = prefs.getString("amount", "");

        // ...
    }
}
```

In this code, we can see that the malicious code is storing sensitive information such as transaction details in a shared preference file. This could be a sign of malicious activity.

By reversing engineering the Santander app's bytecode and analyzing its Java code, researchers were able to detect the malicious code and take steps to prevent it from being executed.
