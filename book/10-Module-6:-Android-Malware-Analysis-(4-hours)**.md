**Module 6: Android Malware Analysis (4 hours)**

In this module, we will delve into the world of Android malware analysis. We will learn how to analyze Android malware, understand its functionality, and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Objective**

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the basics of Android malware
2. Identify common characteristics of Android malware
3. Analyze an Android app for malicious behavior
4. Use various tools and techniques to reverse engineer an Android app

**Prerequisites**

* Basic understanding of Android development and Java programming
* Familiarity with Android Studio or a similar IDE
* Basic knowledge of Linux and command-line interfaces

**What is Android Malware?**

Android malware refers to malicious software that targets Android devices. It can take many forms, such as Trojans, viruses, worms, and spyware. Android malware can cause harm in various ways, including:

1. Data theft: Stealing sensitive information like login credentials or financial data
2. Financial loss: Causing damage by deleting files, encrypting data, or disrupting services
3. Privacy invasion: Monitoring user behavior without consent
4. Device compromise: Taking control of the device or rendering it unusable

**Common Characteristics of Android Malware**

1. **Dropped Files**: Malware often creates and writes to files on the device's internal storage.
2. **Hidden Activities**: Malware may create hidden activities that are not visible in the app drawer.
3. **Unusual Permissions**: Malware may request unusual or unnecessary permissions, such as access to location services or camera.
4. **Obfuscated Code**: Malware may be written in an obfuscated language, making it difficult to understand.
5. **Dynamic Loading of Libraries**: Malware may load libraries dynamically at runtime.

**Analyzing Android Malware**

To analyze Android malware, we can use various tools and techniques:

1. **Android Studio**: Use the built-in decompiler (JD-GUI) or a third-party decompiler like Androguard.
2. **Dex2Jar**: Convert the APK file to Java bytecode for easier analysis.
3. **Androguard**: A comprehensive tool for analyzing Android apps, including disassembly and code visualization.
4. **APK Analyzer**: A free online tool that analyzes APK files and provides information about permissions, services, and more.

**Hands-on Exercise: Analyzing a Sample Malware App**

For this exercise, we will use the sample app "MalwareApp.apk" provided with the course materials. This app is designed to demonstrate common characteristics of Android malware.

1. **Download the APK File**: Download the MalwareApp.apk file and save it on your computer.
2. **Convert the APK to DEX**: Use Dex2Jar to convert the APK file to a DEX file (e.g., MalwareApp.dex).
3. **Decompile the DEX File**: Use Androguard or JD-GUI to decompile the DEX file and view its contents.

**Code for Sample Android App: MalwareApp**

```java
package com.example.malwareapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.Toast;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private Button mButton;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        mButton = findViewById(R.id.button);
        mButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Steal sensitive information
                String info = "Your password is: 12345";
                Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), info, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

**Instructions**

1. **Open Android Studio**: Open Android Studio and create a new project.
2. **Create a New Folder**: Create a new folder in the project directory named "MalwareApp".
3. **Copy the APK File**: Copy the MalwareApp.apk file into the newly created folder.
4. **Convert the APK to DEX**: Use Dex2Jar to convert the APK file to a DEX file (e.g., MalwareApp.dex).
5. **Decompile the DEX File**: Use Androguard or JD-GUI to decompile the DEX file and view its contents.

**Tips and Best Practices**

1. **Use a Virtual Machine**: Run your analysis on a virtual machine to prevent malware from escaping into your main system.
2. **Use a Sandboxing Environment**: Use a sandboxing environment like Android Studio's built-in emulator or a third-party tool like Genymotion.
3. **Keep Your System Up-to-Date**: Ensure your operating system and security software are up-to-date to minimize the risk of malware infection.
4. **Be Cautious with Executable Files**: Be wary of executable files that you download from the internet, as they may contain malware.

**Conclusion**

In this module, we have learned how to analyze Android malware, identify common characteristics, and use various tools and techniques to reverse engineer an Android app. We have also performed a hands-on exercise to demonstrate the process. Remember to always be cautious when working with potentially malicious code and follow best practices for analysis and testing.
