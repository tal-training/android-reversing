**Final Project: Reverse Engineering an Android App**

As part of this Android reverse engineering course, students will work on a final project that applies the skills learned throughout the course to analyze an Android application. This project is designed to give students hands-on experience with reversing an Android app, identifying potential security vulnerabilities, and understanding how the app works.

**Project Overview:**

For this project, students will choose an open-source Android app (e.g., Open Camera) or a sample app provided by the instructor. The goal is to reverse engineer the app, identify its functionality, and analyze its architecture. Students will also be asked to:

1. **Reverse Engineer the App:** Use tools like JD-GUI, APK Analyzer, or Androlib to decompile the app's .dex file (if it's obfuscated) or use a disassembler like Jadx to analyze the app's code.
2. **Identify Components and Architecture:** Analyze the app's components, such as activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers. Study how they interact with each other and the system.
3. **Analyze Code and Data Flow:** Use tools like JD-GUI or Androlib to visualize the app's code structure and data flow. Identify key classes, methods, and variables that control the app's behavior.
4. **Identify Security Vulnerabilities (if any):** Analyze the app's permissions, network communication, and storage access to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
5. **Create a Report:** Write a detailed report summarizing the app's architecture, functionality, and any identified security vulnerabilities.

**Hands-on Exercise:**

For this exercise, we will use Open Camera, an open-source Android camera app, as our example app.

**Step 1: Reverse Engineer the App (JD-GUI)**

Download the Open Camera APK file and extract its contents. Use JD-GUI to decompile the app's .dex file.

[Hands-on Exercise]

1. Download the Open Camera APK file from the official GitHub repository (<https://github.com/ajois/Open-Camera/releases>).
2. Extract the APK file using a tool like Androlib or Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
3. Use JD-GUI to decompile the app's .dex file by pointing it to the extracted APK directory.

**Step 2: Identify Components and Architecture**

Analyze the app's components, such as activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers, using Androlib or JD-GUI.

[Hands-on Exercise]

1. Open Androlib or JD-GUI and navigate to the "Components" tab.
2. Analyze the app's activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers. Note their names, permissions, and roles in the app.

**Step 3: Analyze Code and Data Flow**

Use tools like JD-GUI or Androlib to visualize the app's code structure and data flow.

[Hands-on Exercise]

1. Open JD-GUI or Androlib and navigate to the "Code" tab.
2. Study the app's key classes, methods, and variables that control its behavior. Identify how they interact with each other and the system.

**Step 4: Identify Security Vulnerabilities (if any)**

Analyze the app's permissions, network communication, and storage access to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

[Hands-on Exercise]

1. Review the app's permissions using Androlib or JD-GUI.
2. Analyze the app's network communication and storage access patterns.
3. Identify potential security vulnerabilities based on your findings.

**Step 5: Create a Report**

Write a detailed report summarizing the app's architecture, functionality, and any identified security vulnerabilities.

[Hands-on Exercise]

1. Write a concise introduction to the Open Camera app, including its purpose and features.
2. Provide an overview of the app's components, architecture, and code structure.
3. Summarize your findings on potential security vulnerabilities, if any.
4. Conclude by highlighting key takeaways from the analysis.

**Conclusion:**

In this final project, students will apply their knowledge of Android reverse engineering to analyze a real-world Android app. By following these steps and exercises, they will gain hands-on experience with reversing an Android app, identifying potential security vulnerabilities, and understanding how the app works. This project is designed to simulate the types of challenges that a real-world Android reverse engineer might face when analyzing a commercial app.
