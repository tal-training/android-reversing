**Module 10: Final Project and Conclusion (2 hours)**

In this final module of the Android Reverse Engineering course, you will apply your skills learned throughout the course by reversing an Android application. You will also have the opportunity to conclude the course by summarizing what you've learned and reflecting on how you can apply it in real-world scenarios.

**Objective**

The objective of this module is to:

1. Apply your knowledge of Android reverse engineering techniques to a sample app.
2. Identify and extract sensitive information from an APK file.
3. Analyze the decompiled source code to understand the app's functionality.
4. Reflect on what you've learned throughout the course and think about how you can apply it in real-world scenarios.

**Sample App:**

For this exercise, we will be using a sample Android app called "SecureNotes". This app allows users to store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identification numbers (PINs). The app uses encryption to protect the stored data.

**Reversing the APK File:**

1. Start by obtaining the SecureNotes.apk file.
2. Use a tool like Apktool or Dex2Jar to extract the decompiled source code from the APK file.
3. Review the extracted code and identify the sensitive information stored in the app, such as passwords and PINs.

**Hands-on Exercise:**

To complete this exercise, follow these steps:

1. Download the SecureNotes.apk file and save it to a directory on your computer.
2. Extract the decompiled source code from the APK file using Apktool or Dex2Jar. For example, you can use the following command:
```
apktool d SecureNotes SecureNotes_apk
```
This will extract the decompiled source code to a new directory called "SecureNotes_apk".
3. Open the extracted code in an editor such as Android Studio or Notepad++.
4. Identify and extract sensitive information from the app, such as passwords and PINs.
5. Review the extracted code and analyze the app's functionality.

**Example Code:**

Here is an example of some decompiled source code from the SecureNotes app:
```java
package com.example.securennotes;

import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;
import android.util.Base64;

public class EncryptionHelper {
    public static String encryptString(String input, Context context) {
        try {
            // Generate a secret key
            SecretKey secretKey = generateSecretKey(context);

            // Encrypt the input string using the secret key
            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
            cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
            byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes());

            // Convert the encrypted bytes to a base64-encoded string
            return Base64.encodeToString(encryptedBytes, Base64.NO_WRAP);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("EncryptionHelper", "Error encrypting string: " + e.getMessage());
            return null;
        }
    }

    private static SecretKey generateSecretKey(Context context) {
        try {
            // Generate a secret key using the Android KeyStore
            KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
            keyGen.init(new SecureRandom());
            SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();
            return secretKey;
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            Log.e("EncryptionHelper", "Error generating secret key: " + e.getMessage());
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```
**Conclusion:**

In this module, you applied your knowledge of Android reverse engineering techniques to a sample app and identified sensitive information stored in the app. You also analyzed the decompiled source code to understand the app's functionality.

Throughout this course, you have learned how to reverse engineer an Android application, extract sensitive information from an APK file, and analyze the decompiled source code to understand the app's functionality. These skills are essential for anyone who needs to analyze or debug Android apps, whether it's for security testing, bug fixing, or reverse engineering.

As you move forward with your career in Android development or reverse engineering, remember that these skills will be valuable assets in your toolkit. With practice and experience, you can become proficient in reversing Android applications and extracting sensitive information from APK files.

**Assessment:**

To assess your understanding of this module, complete the following questions:

1. What is the main objective of this module?
2. How do you extract sensitive information from an APK file?
3. What are some common techniques used to reverse engineer an Android application?

Answer these questions in a document or presentation and submit it for assessment.
