**Module 1: Introduction to Android Reverse Engineering (2 hours)**

In this module, we will introduce the basics of Android Reverse Engineering (RE) and provide an overview of the tools and techniques used in RE. We will also explore the motivations for reversing an Android app and discuss some common use cases.

### What is Android Reverse Engineering?

Android Reverse Engineering (RE) involves analyzing and understanding the inner workings of an Android application, typically to identify vulnerabilities, detect malware, or reverse-engineer a competitor's app. The goal of RE is to obtain a deeper understanding of how the app works, including its functionality, data flows, and security features.

### Why Reverse Engineer an Android App?

There are several reasons why you might want to reverse engineer an Android app:

1. **Security**: Identify vulnerabilities and potential threats in the app, such as weak authentication or unsecured data transmission.
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Understand how a competitor's app works, including its features, user interactions, and data flows.
3. **Reverse Engineering for Fun**: Learn about Android RE techniques and tools by reversing an open-source app.

### Tools and Techniques Used in Android Reverse Engineering

1. **IDA Pro**: A disassembler that can be used to analyze executable files and decompile code into a human-readable format.
2. **Jadx**: A tool for decompiling DEX (Dalvik Executable) files, which are the compiled form of Android apps.
3. **APK Analyzer**: A tool for analyzing APK (Android Package File) files, which contain the compiled code and resources of an Android app.
4. **Dex2Jar**: A tool for converting DEX files to JAR (Java Archive) files, which can be used with Java-based RE tools.

### Hands-on Exercise: Reverse Engineer a Sample Android App

For this exercise, we will use the `Jadx` and `APK Analyzer` tools to reverse engineer a sample Android app. We will analyze the app's functionality, data flows, and security features.

**Sample App:** `HelloWorldApp`

The `HelloWorldApp` is a simple Android app that displays a greeting message and allows users to input their name. The app also stores user input in a local SQLite database.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Obtain the APK file**: Download the `HelloWorldApp.apk` file from the course materials.
2. **Analyze the APK file using APK Analyzer**: Use the `APK Analyzer` tool to analyze the contents of the `HelloWorldApp.apk` file. You can use the following command:
```
apkanalyzer dump hello-world-app.apk
```
This will generate a report showing the app's package name, activities, services, and other components.
3. **Decompile the APK file using Jadx**: Use the `Jadx` tool to decompile the `HelloWorldApp.dex` file into Java code. You can use the following command:
```
jadx -d output hello-world-app.apk
```
This will generate a directory containing the decompiled Java code.
4. **Analyze the decompressed code**: Open the `output` directory and analyze the decompiled Java code using an IDE such as Eclipse or Android Studio.
5. **Reverse Engineer the App's Logic**: Use your knowledge of Android development to understand how the app works, including its functionality, data flows, and security features.

**Code for Sample App:**

Here is the code for the `HelloWorldApp`:
```java
// MainActivity.java

package com.example.helloworldapp;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.EditText;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private EditText nameEditText;
    private Button submitButton;
    private TextView greetingTextView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        nameEditText = findViewById(R.id.name_edit_text);
        submitButton = findViewById(R.id.submit_button);
        greetingTextView = findViewById(R.id.greeting_text_view);

        submitButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                String userName = nameEditText.getText().toString();
                greetingTextView.setText("Hello, " + userName + "!");
            }
        });
    }
}

// DBHelper.java

package com.example.helloworldapp;

import android.content.Context;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase;
import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper;

public class DBHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {

    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "hello_world.db";
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

    public DBHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        db.execSQL("CREATE TABLE users (_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);");
    }
}
```
**Conclusion:**

In this module, we introduced the basics of Android Reverse Engineering and provided an overview of the tools and techniques used in RE. We also explored a sample Android app, `HelloWorldApp`, and analyzed its functionality, data flows, and security features using IDA Pro, Jadx, and APK Analyzer.

**Next Module:**

In the next module, we will dive deeper into the world of Android Reverse Engineering and explore more advanced techniques for identifying vulnerabilities and detecting malware. We will also learn how to use RE tools to analyze and understand the inner workings of a complex Android app.
