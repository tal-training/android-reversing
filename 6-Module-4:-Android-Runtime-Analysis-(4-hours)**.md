**Module 4: Android Runtime Analysis (4 hours)**

In this module, we will focus on analyzing the Android runtime environment using various tools and techniques. This is an essential skill for any Android security researcher or developer.

**Objective**

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Understand the Android runtime environment
2. Use various tools to analyze the Android runtime environment
3. Identify potential vulnerabilities in Android apps

**What is the Android Runtime Environment?**

The Android Runtime Environment (ART) is a virtual machine that runs Android apps on Android devices. It is responsible for executing the Dalvik bytecode, which is the intermediate representation of Java code used by the Android SDK.

**Tools Used in this Module**

1. **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**: A command-line tool that allows you to interact with an Android device or emulator.
2. **Android Studio**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Google for building and debugging Android apps.
3. ** JD-GUI**: A Java Decompiler that can be used to decompile Android APKs.

**Hands-on Exercise 1: Using ADB**

In this exercise, we will use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to analyze an Android app.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Download and install Android Studio.
2. Create a new project in Android Studio and choose "Empty Activity" as the template.
3. Write the following code into the `MainActivity.java` file:
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```
4. Create a new directory named "myapp" and place the `MainActivity.java` file inside it.
5. Compile the app using Android Studio (Build > Make Project).
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "myapp" directory.
7. Use ADB to push the APK to an emulator or device:
```
adb push myapp.apk /sdcard/
```
8. Use ADB to install the app on the emulator or device:
```
adb install /sdcard/myapp.apk
```
9. Use ADB to start the app:
```
adb shell am start -n com.example.myapp/.MainActivity
```

**Hands-on Exercise 2: Using JD-GUI**

In this exercise, we will use JD-GUI to decompile an Android APK.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Download and install JD-GUI.
2. Create a new directory named "myapp" and place the `MainActivity.java` file inside it.
3. Compile the app using Android Studio (Build > Make Project).
4. Use ADB to push the APK to an emulator or device:
```
adb push myapp.apk /sdcard/
```
5. Open JD-GUI and select the "Open APK" option.
6. Navigate to the `myapp` directory and select the `myapp.apk` file.
7. Click on the "OK" button to start the decompilation process.

**What's Next**

In the next module, we will focus on Android instrumentation testing using Espresso.
